# 💡 Future Work

TruthSnap is currently a heuristic prototype aimed at flagging potentially misleading content.  
To evolve into a more robust tool, here are possible development paths:

---

## 🔍 1. Integration with Fact-Checking APIs

- Connect with APIs such as [Google Fact Check Tools](https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/), [Snopes](https://snopes.com/), or [PolitiFact](https://politifact.com/).  
- Cross-check detected claims against verified fact-check databases.

## 🧠 2. NLP-Powered Detection

- Utilize transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT) fine-tuned for fake news detection.  
- Compare text embeddings with a verified claims dataset.

## 🌐 3. Multilingual & Regional Support

- Add support for Portuguese (Brazil/Portugal) and other languages.  
- Develop specialized models for local topics (politics, health, economy).

## ✍️ 4. Inline Highlighting & Explanations

- Highlight suspicious phrases inline within the text.  
- Provide contextual explanations for each flagged section.

## 📦 5. Offline, Mobile & PWA Versions

- Develop a Progressive Web App (PWA) for offline use.  
- Create desktop or lightweight app versions for low-connectivity areas.

## ⚖️ 6. Bias Auditing, Transparency & Explainability

- Monitor and reduce biases in heuristics and algorithms.  
- Make the system auditable by clearly showing the reasoning behind each decision.
