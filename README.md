# 🔍 TruthSnap

**TruthSnap** is a lightweight, educational tool that simulates a fake news detection mechanism. By analyzing user-submitted text, it flags potential signs of manipulation based on tone, language patterns, and structure — all without relying on external APIs or machine learning.

## 🧠 The Problem

Misinformation spreads faster than facts — especially when wrapped in emotional, misleading language. Most people can't distinguish between subtle manipulation and objective reporting.

## 💡 The Solution

TruthSnap offers a quick “gut check” for any piece of content. It simulates how experts might scan for red flags in news articles, blog posts, or social media content using handcrafted rules based on:

- Emotional language intensity
- Clickbait indicators (excessive caps, exclamations, absolutes)
- Lack of citations or vague sources
- Repetition of certain keywords

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Paste a news excerpt or social media post
2. Click "Analyze"
3. TruthSnap runs a basic textual analysis and shows one of the following:
   - ✅ Likely Trustworthy
   - ⚠️ Needs Caution
   - ❌ Potentially Misleading

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5 (semantic layout)
- CSS3 (responsive design)
- JavaScript (basic text analysis logic)
- Git & GitHub (version control)

## 🧪 Features

- Instant, rule-based analysis
- No external dependencies
- Works entirely in the browser
- Educational and privacy-friendly (no data sent anywhere)

## 🚧 Future Improvements

| Version | Feature                                |
|---------|----------------------------------------|
| 1.1     | Word frequency analysis                |
| 1.2     | User feedback loop (Was it accurate?)  |
| 2.0     | Backend logic + real-time news scraping|
